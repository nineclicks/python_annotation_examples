### [register_a_function.py](register_a_function.py)
- Pretty common use of annotations for registering a function to some event or whatnot.
### [annotation_with_params.py](annotation_with_params.py)
- Make an annotation function that itself can take parameters.
### [basic.py](basic.py)
- Demonstrates how python annotations run and overwrite a function. Not super useful aside from understanding annotations.
### [basic_wrapper_lambda.py](basic_wrapper_lambda.py)
- Basic wrapper with a lambda instead of closure.
### [annotation_arg_passthrough.py](annotation_arg_passthrough.py)
